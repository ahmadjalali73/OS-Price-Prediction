Imagine that you are in a world, where you know all the details configuration of a mobile, but you don't know what is the OS it is using
:)

In this world, we are going to help you guess the OS with the help of some machine learning classifcation algorithms. For being easier to read codes and files, I have seperated the cleaning part from training our models. So you will see all the details for data cleaning with all the charts you need in OS_pred_cleaning.ipynb and various models from different algorithms will be trained and tested in OS_Prediction.ipynb file. 

Hope you Learn good stuffs.
